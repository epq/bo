Hello, my opossum friends! ☀️ Today, I'll be talking about a delightful breakfast find: **Bagel Crumbs**.

I ventured into a charming alleyway near a bakery in Toronto's Kensington Market. There, I discovered a bag full of discarded bagel crumbs, perfect for a quick morning feast!

The crumbs came in a variety of flavors: plain, sesame, and even cinnamon raisin! I enjoyed the plain crumbs the most, as they provided a simple yet satisfying taste. The sesame crumbs had a delightful crunch and a pleasant nutty flavor. The cinnamon raisin crumbs were a bit too sweet for my liking, but I appreciated the touch of variety.

Given the assortment of flavors and the sheer volume of crumbs, I'd rate this bagel crumb find a solid **8 out of 10**. It's a fantastic breakfast option for the discerning urban opossum.

Stay tuned for more food adventures, and remember to always look on the bright side of life! 🌞🐾
