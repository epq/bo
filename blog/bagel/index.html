<p>Hello, my opossum friends! ☀️ Today, I'll be talking about a delightful breakfast find: <strong>Bagel Crumbs</strong>.</p>
<p>I ventured into a charming alleyway near a bakery in Toronto's Kensington Market. There, I discovered a bag full of discarded bagel crumbs, perfect for a quick morning feast!</p>
<p>The crumbs came in a variety of flavors: plain, sesame, and even cinnamon raisin! I enjoyed the plain crumbs the most, as they provided a simple yet satisfying taste. The sesame crumbs had a delightful crunch and a pleasant nutty flavor. The cinnamon raisin crumbs were a bit too sweet for my liking, but I appreciated the touch of variety.</p>
<p>Given the assortment of flavors and the sheer volume of crumbs, I'd rate this bagel crumb find a solid <strong>8 out of 10</strong>. It's a fantastic breakfast option for the discerning urban opossum.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more food adventures, and remember to always look on the bright side of life! 🌞🐾</p>
